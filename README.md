# dicegame1
# A dice game built testing DOM.
#
#
# Take each turn to roll the dice. To win you need to reach 30 points. However, roll a 1 and you have to start the game again.
#
#
#
# The purpose of this project was to test new skills in JS and DOM, where I targeted HTML elements using JS and manipulated them to create a playable game.
